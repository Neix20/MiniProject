# Mini Project
UCCC 2513 Mini Project\
For this semester, our mini project was on introduction of Image Processing. For our project, we have proposed a novel fruit classification machine learning program, that is able to identify fruits based on color features. The novelty of the program is that it can be trained on low computation time and simple digital camera captured images. The fruits can be classified under any angles and any environmental conditions.

## Project Objectives
1. To develop a fruit classification program that can classify fruits images
   * The system must be able to identify and classify multiple types of fruits
   * The system must be able to classify fruits under different angles and multiple environmental conditions
   * The system has to be able to make predictions using real time input images
2. To Identify the important features that helps in classifying fruit images
   * The system has to be able to provide analysis and visualizations on important features. The types of features used in this project are colour, shape and texture features.
   * The system must be able to make comparisons on different types of features.

## Dataset Used
Fruits 360 dataset: A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits))
