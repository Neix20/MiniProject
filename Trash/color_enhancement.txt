1. Color Enhancement
Convert The Image to Float
you split the image to Three images of R, G, B values Seperately
To enhance the colors, we sum the RGB Values to produce a 4th matrix, which is the total sum of each individual pixel values, and then we divide the R, G, B matrix by the sumed up matrix
Then we normalize the 3 divided matrix, and we merge it into a new image
This produces an effect, where the original colors like red, blue and green are enhanced, whereas secondary colors such as orange, yellow become more dull.
This also removes any white pigment in the image.
